            <p>When you use the &lt;meta&gt; element to define the character encoding of a website, it takes a charset attribute. The value given to the charset attribute is usually UTF-8, which is the character encoding for Unicode. Unicode is a 16-bit character set designed to cover all the world's major languages, and as such should cover most of your needs as a developer.</p>
