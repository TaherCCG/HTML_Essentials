      The content attribute of the meta element contains its values. This is used with the name attribute to specify metadata about the page.
      
      A meta description is an HTML element that provides a brief summary of a web page. A page's meta description tag is displayed as part 
      of the search snippet in a search engine results page (SERP) and is meant to give the user an idea of the content that exists within 
      the page and how it relates to their search query.

    <p>It should be said that the metadata in the head of your page is not the only thing needed for good SEO. Making sure your content is clear and that you have used appropriate semantic HTML elements is also important.</p>
