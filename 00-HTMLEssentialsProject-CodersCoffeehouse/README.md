# Coders Coffeehouse
## HTML Essential Project - HTML only

The HTML essentials walkthrough project was to create Coders Coffehouse website, which is a cafe based in Dublin facilitating coders with free wifi while they enjoy a cup of coffee.

I have broken the project down to 2 parts, the 1st is the HTML structure code only without any CSS styling.  This helps me understand the structure of the HTML code.

The 2nd part is the full project with CSS styling added.  This helps me understand how to apply the CSS styling to make the website look much better and user friendly.
