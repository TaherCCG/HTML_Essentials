<!--
  aria-label allows us to specify a string to be used as the accessible label. This overrides any 
  other native labeling mechanism, such as a label element â€” for example, if a button has both text 
  content and an aria-label, only the aria-label value will be used.
  
  You might use an aria-label attribute when you have some kind of visual indication of an element's purpose, 
  such as a button that uses a graphic instead of text, but still need to clarify that purpose for anyone who 
  cannot access the visual indication, such as a button that uses only an image to indicate its purpose.
